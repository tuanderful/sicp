> The sine of an angle specified in radians can be computed by making use of the approximation sin _x_ ≈ _x_ if _x_ is sufficiently small,
and the trigonometric identity sin _x_ = 3 sin _x_/3 - 4 sin³ _x_/3 to reduce the size of the argument of sin.

```scheme
(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
  (print ".")
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

(print (sine 100000))
```
> How many times is the procedure applied when `(sine 12.15)` is evaluated?

6

> What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of _a_) used by the process generated by the `sine` procedure when `(sine a)` is evalutated?

The growth in space and the number of steps grows unbounded as a function of _a_.
