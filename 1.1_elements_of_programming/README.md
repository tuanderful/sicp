# Elements of Programming

Mechanisms for combining simple ideas to form more complex ideas:
* primitive expressions
* means of combination
* means of abstraction

## Expressions
__Compound expression__ expressions representing values, be combined with expressions representing a primitive procedure

__Combinations__ list of expressions within parens

```
(<operator> <operands>)
```

__REPL__ read-evaluate-print loop

## Naming and the Environment
Use `define` to name things, to identify a variable whose value is a computational object.
```
(define <name> <value>)
```
_define is a **special form**_, an exception to the general evaluation rule.

__environment__ memory that keeps track of name-object pairs

## Evaluating Combinations
1. Evaluate the subexpressions
2. Apply the procedure that is the value of the operator, to the operands.

__tree accumulation__ process for evaluating treelike objects (includes "percolating vaues upward")

## Compound Procedures
__procedure definition__ an abstraction technique, to give compound operations a name

```scheme
(define (square x) (* x x))
```

Defining a procedure takes the following format:
```
(define (<name> <formal params>) <body>)
```

`<body>` is an expression that will yield the value of the procedure application when the formal params are replaced by actual arguments.

## Substitution Model for Procedure Application
* Evaluate the body to the procedure with each formal parameter replaced by the corresponding argument

__Applicative Order Evaluation__

__Normal Order Evaluation__
